# Code Spaces on Github Cloud Project

## Overview

The main objective of this project is to introduce students to Code Spaces on Github Cloud. This technology empowers developers by reducing the overhead complexities associated with setting up a new development environment. It reduces the need to configure your computer for each project, allowing developers to use predefined or customizable configurations on the cloud.

This project will guide you through practical steps required to set up and use code spaces effectively. Apart from the project itself, a video tutorial is included to help understand the concepts better and allow learning at your own pace.

## Educational Objectives 

Upon completion of the project, students will:

* Understand what Github Code Spaces is and how to use it.
* Learn how to configure a code space.
* Be able to create, use, and delete a code space.
* Manage code changes within a code space and share the changes with a team.

## Instructions

The project consists of a theoretical part and a practical task. The theoretical part explains what Github Code Spaces is and why it was developed. The practical task involves creating, modifying, and deleting a code space.

## Procedure

* Watch the included video tutorial to understand the underlying concepts and project steps.
* Follow the instructions as provided in the video to create your first code space.
* Explore the options provided to customize the code space as per your requirements.
* Practice code modifications within the code space and experiment with various features from the UI.
* Learn how to delete a code space when you no longer need it.

## Aiding Material

To help you with this project, we have included:

* Practical examples
* Video tutorial
* FAQs
